# eachgit.pl

Runs git commands on multiple repos at once

# SYNOPSIS

    # Run 'git grep "Some String"' for all repos under '/path/to/repos':
    ./eachgit.pl /path/to/repos grep \"Some String\"
    
    # Show git status for all repos in the current dir:
    ./eachgit.pl . status

# DESCRIPTION

Very simple script lets you run a git command multiple on repos at once. 
See the SYNOPSIS for usage.

I wrote this specifically so I could run `git grep` on all my repos at once, but
any git command works, too.
